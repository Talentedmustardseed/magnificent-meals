	<p>I think my website is okay regarding aesthetic appeal. It's easy to use and suitable
for adolescents. However, I think it could've been better if I added some interactive features such
as quizzes. I could've also made the overall display of the website look a bit more interesting by adding 
attractive colour combinations, more images and polishing up the website. I could've also worked on my 
game more. The advantage with coding your website using HTML/CSS is that it dramatically increases the
loading time on your browser. I hope adolescents have now realised the importance of food by engaging in 
this website, and I hope they follow all the advice that has been given to them.</p>
