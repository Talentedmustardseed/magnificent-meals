	  <li><p>Decrease the sugar. Excess sugar can cause tooth decay, and, if you
are affected by diabetes or a diabete-related condition, you are at extreme risk of
heart disease.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Increase cocoa bean concentration. Cocoa beans are the only healthy
thing found in chocolate. They have lots of fibre, and decrease blood pressure, improve
cholestrol levels and decrease blood sugar levels.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Remove artificial colours and flavours. Artificial colours and flavours
can be found in some chocolates. Some artificial flavours/colours are known to cause cancer.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Replace vanillin with authentic vanilla. Vanillin is a cheap alternative for
vvanilla and can be found in some vanilla-flavoured chocolates. Research has shown that this substance
can cause allergic reactions, digestive disorders and migraine headaches.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Remove HFCS (High-Fructose corn syrup). High fructose corn syrup is usually used in
some chocolate brands in order to make them taste sweeter. HFCS can cause obesity, diabetes, heart 
disease and cancer. </p></li>
	</ol>
	<p> By removing these substances, chocolate can be way healthier than it used to be. Sure, it may
make it taste worse, but it's really a small price to pay considering all the health risks.</p><br>
