	  <ol>
	    <li>Pour the tamari into a large dish and stir in the curry powder, 
cumin, garlic and honey. Mix well.</li>
	    <li>Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 fillets 
in total, then add to the marinade and mix well to coat. Set aside in the fridge 
for at least 1 hr, or overnight, to allow the flavours to penetrate the chicken.</li>

lime juice, and 1 tbsp water to make a spoonable sauce.</li>
	    <li>When ready to cook the chicken, wipe a large non-stick frying pan
with a little oil. Add the chicken and cook, covered with a lid, for 5-6 mins on 
a medium heat, turning the fillets over for the last min, until cooked but still 
moist. Set aside, covered, to rest for a few mins.</li>
	    <li>While the chicken rests, toss the lettuce wedges with the cucumber, 
shallot, coriander and pomegranate, and pile onto plates. Spoon over a little sauce.</li>
	    <li>Slice the chicken, pile on top of the salad and spoon over the remaining 
sauce. Eat while the chicken is still warm.</li>
